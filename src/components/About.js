                    The scope of the project is to build a platform that connects coffee lovers, shop owners, and coffee experts. The platform will allow users to discover new coffee shops based on location and menu offerings, share reviews and photos, and engage with the coffee community. Shop owners will be able to promote their businesses, manage listings, and interact with customers by showcasing special deals and events. Coffee experts will provide insights and tips, enriching usersâ€™ knowledge of coffee. The platform will serve as a hub for exploring, sharing, and celebrating coffee culture.
